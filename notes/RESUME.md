# Resume guide (updated 2026-10-06 ~11:30 UTC = 20:30 KST, end of day)

Goal: public LB RMSE <= 10.

## End of day 2026-10-06 (read this first)
- Public LB so far: blend_v2 12.3454, v4 12.0329, v6 11.9248, **v7 11.8795** (best). In all four, public came in
  0.55-0.6 below the nested CV. LB #1 that day: 9.2442.
- File handed over for the remaining slot (today's last or 00:00 KST 2026-10-07): **blend_v10** = v7 pool + the two
  laptop-GPU CNNs. Nested CV 12.4242 vs v7 12.4254 (bootstrap 90% of the difference [-0.032, 0.031]), so it is a tie:
  weights cs24 0.244, feat6_rest_ridge_all 0.393, feat3 lgbs 0.166, feat5 milspl 0.089, feat2 lgbs hetN 0.038,
  effnetv2-s CNN 0.07. Test predictions differ from v7 by sd 0.30 (max 1.25), so expect public about 11.88.
  CSV in `/mnt/project-files/work/hardness-cache/submissions/`. When the user reports the score, add it to
  `experiments/LEADERBOARD.md` and memory.
- Laptop GPU run (RTX 5060, exclusive use 19:16-20:11 KST, returned with the done file; plan in
  `notes/handoff/laptop-gpu.md`), base flags `--input raw+nlm --deg-p 0.5 --cons 1.0 --pool avg --epochs 30`, lr 1e-3:
  | experiment | seeds | CV | time per fold-seed | blend weight |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `cnn_r18_rawnlm_degcons_gpu` (resnet18) | 3 | 13.593 | ~31 s | 0 |
  | `cnn_ev2s_rawnlm_degcons_gpu_s3` (tf_efficientnetv2_s.in21k_ft_in1k) | 3 | 13.246 | ~76 s | 0.07 |
  CNN residuals correlate 0.93 with the blend; even the best in-sample mix of resnet18 into v7 is weight 0. More seeds or
  bigger backbones of the same CNN are unlikely to move the blend. lr 3e-4 was not screened.
- The laptop session returned results as messages (2-decimal values in ID order plus checksums); the cloud copies and
  checking script are in the hardness-cache (`laptop-gpu-2026-10-06/`, `scripts/ingest.py`, `scripts/paired.py`).
- No CPU candidate beat v7 either (restored-image embeddings, restored-feature GBM, add-alongside ridge, tercile
  stacker, stretch recalibration, curated subsets).
- Where the error is: the noisy SNR tercile (blend about 14.7 vs about 11 on the other two) and coarse-grain images,
  whose extra variance tested as per-grain label noise the image does not show (every probe null; list in memory).
- Untested ideas for the next session, best first:
  1. A restorer trained only on low-SNR degradations, then restored features + ridge for the noisy tercile (restoration
     so far helps the mid tercile, not the noisy one).
  2. A CNN on raw + restored channels on the laptop GPU (needs `data_restored/` and `restore_unet.pt` on the laptop).
  3. Only if 2 gets real blend weight: more GPU seeds/backbones.

## Cloud container lesson (pause 2026-10-06 07:05-07:38 UTC)
- The container sleeps a few minutes after the session goes idle and kills every detached job (the restorer's training
  died at step 3500 that day). Checkpoint long jobs (`src/restore.py --ckpt-every`, `train_cnn` per fold-seed caches).
- In a fresh session, re-brief agents from `notes/handoff/*.md`; agent ids from an old session do not carry over.

## Where we are (2026-10-06 evening)
| model family | best saved experiment | CV RMSE |
|---|---|---|
| OOF blend (NNLS, nested CV) | `blend_v10` (ties `blend_v7`, public 11.8795) | **12.42** |
| handcrafted features | `feat6_rest_ridge_add` / `feat6_rest_ridge_all` (restored-image features) | 12.52 / 12.53 |
| frozen embeddings | `emb_effv2s_256_gridge3_noise_csbag_rawrest` | 12.84 |
| CNN fine-tune | `cnn_ev2s_rawnlm_degcons_gpu_s3` (laptop GPU) | 13.25 |
| baseline | `feat_lgb` | 14.20 |

Target std is 17.7 (mean predictor). Submission CSVs are git-ignored; copies are in the hardness-cache `submissions/`.

## Cross-agent findings (read before planning)
- All families capture the same signal: residual correlations 0.87-0.93; blends gain only about 0.3-0.6.
  Getting to 10 needs a new signal, not more of the same models.
- Dark-phase fraction dominates (per-grain fraction Spearman about 0.7 on clean images). Normalise by the
  local matrix level: shading (13-19 grey levels) is comparable to the phase contrast (about 30).
- Error rises with image noise: about 12 on the cleaner half vs about 15 on the noisier half.
  Denoising the input hurts embeddings but an extra NLM channel helps the CNN.
- The target is heteroscedastic: coarse-structure images have hardness std 21.5 vs 13.5 for fine ones,
  and OOF RMSE 16.7 vs 9.3. Nothing measured so far explains the extra variance in coarse images.
  This is the biggest open question; candidates: a location-dependent label (e.g. an indent-like local
  sample), a grain-level property not yet measured, or label noise built into the generator.
- Every model regresses to the mean (RMSE about 18 in the extreme target quintiles vs about 9 in the middle).
- With 500 images, differences under about 0.1 RMSE are noise; single-fold screens are about ±0.4.
- `src/train_gbm.py` `feat_lgb` / `feat_cat` used early stopping on the validation fold (optimistic). Newer runs use fixed trees.

## Spatial-heterogeneity signal (2026-10-06 afternoon, eda-analyst; experiments/eda/NOTES.md from line 96)
- Part of the coarse-image "label noise" is model error. Images with zones of large grains next to zones of small grains
  are harder than their mean grain size predicts, and global pooling or global mean-size features average this away.
- Three per-image feature files (train + test, fixed transforms): `data/eda_feats_lledge.parquet` (block heterogeneity of
  edge energy), `data/eda_feats_ecs.parquet` (cross-cell std of g2a embeddings), `data/eda_feats_lf.parquet` (local
  grain-size field; GBMs only). Copies are in the hardness-cache `data/`.
- Fold-paired gains: ridge het 13.101 -> 12.824 (5/5 folds); lgbs het 12.991 -> 12.771 (4/5); blend about -0.18.
- Cross-fitted probes are needed for residual tests: naive OOF-residual probes are biased negative by stacking leakage.

## Noise-floor finding (2026-10-06 morning, eda-analyst) - SUPERSEDED by the section above; the floor is only an upper bound
- Residual variance follows label noise ~ b/N (N = calibrated grain count `cal_seg_count_density*6.5536`,
  b about 28k, 90% CI 21.9k-32.4k) plus a measurement term ~ c/snr. Clean images already sit at that floor
  in every grain-size tercile (orchestrator re-check: clean coarse 14.5 vs floor 14.5, mid 9.2 vs 9.7, fine 7.8 vs 7.8).
- Floor for a perfect model: train CV about 11.2-11.6, full test about 10.7-11.1; public 300 subset median 10.7
  [9.2, 12.2]. LB <= 10 is out of reach on expectation; blend_v2 is expected around public 12.6 [11.4, 13.8].
- All reducible error is in degraded (noisy/blurred) images: focus on measurement under noise/blur
  (calibration v2, NLM channel for CNNs, training on synthetic degradations). Stop adding coarse-image grain,
  location or texture features (all null). Public-LB differences under about 0.3 are noise.

## Compute notes
- Cloud sandbox: 4 CPU (Xeon with AMX), no GPU. bf16 + channels_last makes CNN training about 3x faster.
  Budget threads per agent (e.g. CNN 2, features 1, embeddings 1) when running agents in parallel.
- Laptop GPU (RTX 5060 8GB): this project's device folder is `C:\Daker\microstructure-hardness-prediction`
  (branch checked out, data copied to `data\`, `.venv` with torch 2.11+cu128). The GPU is shared with the user's
  robot project. Ask the user which mode applies before running anything on it:
  - shared: wrap every GPU command as
    `python C:\Dacon\RobotWorldModel_ActionVideo\wm_ops\gpu_turn.py --who hardness -- <command>`; on CUDA OOM lower `--bs`;
  - exclusive hand-over (as on 2026-10-06 19:16 KST): `--device cuda` directly, then return the GPU with PowerShell
    `New-Item C:\Dacon\WM_Runtime\hardness_gpu_done` when all GPU work is done.
  Never touch the robot project otherwise.
- "Jev" (TypeSafe AI) is a remote, text-only API model and is banned by competition rule 2, so it is not used.
